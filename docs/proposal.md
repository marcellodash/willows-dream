# Proposal

## Overview

Willow's Dream is set to be an open-source platformer game with RPG elements developed for the Sega Genesis. There are many advantages to developing a modern game for an older generation game console:

* Staying true to iconic themes and concepts will gain the reverence of niche communities of retro game collectors.
* Designing within the system's hardware limitations will make for an exciting challenge.
* Keeping the project an open-source and collaborative experience will provide a platform for others to be inspired.
* Due to the wide availability of software and hardware emulators, developing for a vintage console will ensure cross-platform distribution (ex: [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/), [Retron](https://hyperkin.com/Retron5/), etc.). Additionally, emulators can be packaged with digital copies of the game that are configured to be easy (if not automatic) for any computer user to launch.

## Concept

### Characters

The story of _Willow's Dream_ begins with Willow, an adventurous young girl, and her pet kitten, Sassafras.

Willow, with her bright red hair and frighteningly blue eyes, is both lucky to have been raised in a nurturing household with her single mother (_yet to be named_) and aggravated for being shielded from the adventures of the world. Her mother, being very protective, has not given Willow the opportunity to make new friends and inevitable mistakes preferring that she be home-schooled by and kept under the watchful eye of her grandmother (_yet to be named_) while she is away at work.

Willow's only friend and sidekick, Sassafras, a runt of his litter, has helped her through the worst of her loneliness. With his dark black fur and discerning green eyes, he has a strong will and playful nature. He will be an essential teammate for the two to power through their future adventures.

### Story

The game opens up to a scene of her mother leaving Willow and Sassafras to sleep away on a starry night. After her mother turns off the lights of her bedroom and Willow and Sassafras fall fast asleep, the light reflecting off the full moon begins to flood the darkness of the room entering in through the window. A bright, glimmering Willow wakes up and begins to get out of bed leaving a faded version of herself behind her. She steps out into the center of the room where the moonlight is the brightest and starts to fade away into the rippling light. As Willow disappears, Sassafras wakes up and jumps after Willow, also leaving behind a faded image of himself. The scene ends by rippling out into a purple hypnotic trance.

Willow and Sassafras pop into a new, bright world and fall hastily through the cloudy sky. Their descent slows and they land gracefully in a green pasture. The landscape looks both familiar and fantastical with vegetation that has a form of earthly origin but with unimaginable color. Here, the game introduces the player to the basic mechanics in a natural manner with harmless obstacles. Thorns that the player must jump over, a log that they need to push over a river, and bushes that they need to attack to clear may lie in their path.

After traversing these obstacles, the two adventurers enter a village where it's inhabitants (_the native people's of the Dream World are yet to be determined_) are clearly distressed. Here, the characters are introduced to the nightmares and their evil leader that are plaguing the _Dream World_. After accepting the challenges before them and collecting any supplies the two might need, they make their way out of the village.

> Once the player leaves the starting village, the game enters a world view either similar to [Super Mario World](http://www.next-gamer.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Super-Mario-World-Karte.jpg) or [Zelda II: The Adventure of Link](faqsmedia.ign.com/faqs/image/reyvgm_zelda2.gif). The following worlds, enemies, story, and dialogue are yet to be determined, but will feature some of Willow and Sassafras' greatest fears (ie. spiders, zombies, ghosts).

### Thematic Concepts

One of the major themes in the story is presented first by the two main characters' names. The ability for trees to branch out and grow from small saplings to large, wizened oaks resonates with the growth that Willow experiences during her adventures in the Dream World.

Throughout the dialogue, Sassafras, the kitten, interacts naturally with Willow and other inhabitants of the _Dream World_ in some form of _catspeak_. It is implied that the characters understand the kitten entirely and supplement his dialogue by providing enough context for the player to understand. If the player enters a certain pattern in the menu screen, it will change the undiscernible dialogue of Sassafras to full English just as if he were a normal character adding a new dimension to the dialogue.

## Artwork

The visual artwork of Willow's Dream is going to push the boundaries of the Sega Genesis's video capabilities. Though the artwork will stay true to the vintage appeal and data limitations of 16-bit pixel art, advanced visual effects such as particles and parallax scrolling will be employed to enhance the user experience and visual depth of the 2D graphics.

The artwork timeline will go in three phases: concept art, 16-bit pixel art interpretation, and final refinement for hardware implementation.

## Gameplay

### Feature Overview

Willow's Dream will incorporate many typical gameplay components of platformers: jumping, pushing/pulling obstacles, climbing, basic attacking, etc. Each level will take these basic elements and utilize them in new ways to overcome enemies and solve puzzles.

#### Game Modes

* Single player or co-op story mode with levels employing different gameplay elements and characters/themes.
* Quick multiplayer game modes. More than 2 teams (or 1-2 players each) will enable split screen graphics such as [Sonic the Hedgehog 2](http://www.segabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SEQSAT7.png). Different game types and minigames will be implemented if ROM size allows for it.
* In multiplayer game modes (story or minigame), players can play cooperatively as either Willow or Sassafras. When in singleplayer game modes (story or against computer-controlled players in minigames), the player's companion, Sassafras, is controlled by the computer to assist in combat as well as where necessary to solve puzzles.

#### Graphics

* Original 16-bit pixel sprite and tile art
* Parallax background elements
* Particle effects
* Frame animations (for most foreground elements)
* Skeletal animations (for some characters/bosses)

## Distribution

Willow's Dream will primarily be distributed online for use with software emulators, but small-scale commercial hardware distribution at a local scale and online is going to be a key-factor to the release and reputation of this project.

Currently, there are no plans for crowd-funding this project. If community interest rises and the team reaches a strong milestone in development, utilizing popular crowd-funding resources such as [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) or [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) may be considered.

## License

It is in the best interest of the project and it's potential community to maintain an open-source model. In initial development, external contributions will not be considered to maintain healthy control over story and gameplay by the team. During later stages of development, community contributions through beta testing and pull requests will be encouraged.

> Currently, the project is licensed with the GNU LGPL V3.0 license. This permits that the code, multimedia assets, and distributable software is all available freely for viewing, execution, and non-commercial distribution. Commercial sale of the project by a third-party is not permitted without a written agreement between the project's creators and the distributor in question. If a derivative project that is deemed significantly different than it's predecessor is created with the freely available code and assets, then it is permitted to be sold commercially in digital or physical form.
