# Willow's Dream <small>Proposal</small>

## Overview

Willow's Dream is set to be a open-source platformer game with RPG elements developed for the Sega Genesis with plans to port the game to the SNES. There are many advantages to developing a modern game for an older generation game console.

* Staying true to iconic themes and concepts will gain the reverence of niche communities of retro game collectors.
* Carefully designing within the system's hardware limitations will make for an exciting challenge.
* Keeping the project an open-source and collaborative experience will provide a platform for others to be inspired.
* Due to the wide availability of software and hardware emulators, developing for a vintage console will ensure cross-platform distribution (ex: [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/), [Retron](https://hyperkin.com/Retron5/), etc).

### Feature Overview

Willow's Dream will incorporate many of the features of later Sega Genesis games as well as some unique capabilities.

#### Game

* Single player or co-op story mode with multiple levels employing different gameplay elements and characters/themes.
* Quick multiplayer game modes. More than 2 teams (or 1-2 players each) will enable split screen graphics similar to [Sonic the Hedgehog 2](http://www.segabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SEQSAT7.png). Multiple game types and minigames could be implemented if ROM size allows for it.

#### Graphics

* Original 16-bit pixel sprite and tile artwork.
* Parallax background elements.

## Distribution

Willow's Dream will primarily be distributed online for use with software emulators, but small-scale commercial hardware distribution at a local scale and online is going to be a key-factor to the release and reputation of this project.

Currently, there are no plans for crowd-funding this project. If community interest rises and the team reaches a strong milestone in development, utilizing popular crowd-funding resources such as [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) or [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) my be considered.

## License

It is in the best interest of the project and it's potential community to maintain an open-source model. In initial development, external contributions will not considered heavily in order to maintain healthy control over story and gameplay. During later stages of development, community contributions through beta testing and pull requests will be encouraged.

> Currently, the project is licensed with the GNU LGPL V3.0 license. This permits that the code, multimedia assets, and distributable software is all available freely for viewing, execution, and non-commercial distribution. Commercial sale of the project by a third-party is not permitted without a written agreement between the project's creators and the distributor in question. If a derivative project that is deemed significantly different than it's predecessor is created with the freely available code and assets, then it is permitted to be sold commercially in digital or physical form.
