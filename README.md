# Willow's Dream

An Action-RPG homebrew ROM game developed for the Sega Genesis built on the SGDK library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

All prerequisites are included in the master repository and do not require additional configuration.

```
SGDK*
DGen
```
<sub>\* = Required</sub>

### Installing

Compile all project dependencies by running _build_lib.bat_ located in the project's top level directory. This will set PATH variables for and compile _SGDK_. _DGen_ is included precompiled and doesn't require system configuration.

You can now compile the project, _Willow's Dream_, by using the _build.bat_ file located in the project's top level directory. This batch file will ask if you would like to open the compiled rom in DGen to playtest the game on emulation software.

## Deployment

Physical distribution for commercial use (whether in cartridge or compact format) is not permitted whereas for personal use is strongly recommended as this game is intended to be used on the original Sega Genesis/Mega Drive hardware.

## Built With

* [SDGK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki) - The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive development kit used
* [DGEN/SDL](http://dgen.sourceforge.net/) - The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive emulator used for testing
* [DefleMask](http://deflemask.com/) - Multi-system chiptune tracker used to compose music and export music ROM files
